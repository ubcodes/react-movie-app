Welcome to the React Movie Web App! This project is a web application built using React, allowing users to search for various movies and explore their details. The application utilizes a movie API to fetch movie data and provide an interactive user experience.

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Users can easily search for movies by entering keywords or specific movie titles. The app queries the movie API to fetch relevant results based on the search query.

- **Movie Details**: Upon selecting a movie from the search results, users can access detailed information about the movie, such as its title, release year, plot summary, cast, and other relevant details.

- **Responsive Design**: The web app is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.
